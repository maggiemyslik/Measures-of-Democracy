## üîç Overview

This project critically evaluates the statistical methodology used in the **Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) index**, one of the most influential datasets used to measure democratic quality worldwide.It explores how expert-coded measures are aggregated, how coder uncertainty is quantified, and how V-Dem compares to other global democracy indices in terms of structure, variance, and potential bias.

## üõ† Methods

- **Statistical Decomposition** of coder variance estimates
- **Bias Adjustment Analysis** of anchoring vignettes and prior weighting
- **Correlation Analysis** across democracy indices (V-Dem, FH, Polity, EIU)
- **Uncertainty Visualization** using error bounds on country-level scores
- All analysis conducted in Python using `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `lets-plot`
